Solr Benchmark Proforma
=======================

Date: 2015 Sept 8
Description of benchmark: RESTART. Performed after ~506,000 JISC WARCs submitted, commited but not optimized. Was trying to ingest more data but the server SSD disks became full and ingest stopped (actually put on hold whilst waiting for more diskspace but that wasn't going to happen.) Addressed by reducing the reserved blocks to 1% (from default of 5%).
